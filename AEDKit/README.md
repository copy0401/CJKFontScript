CJKFontScript - AEDKit
=============

<b>Since Apr 18, 2015, the AEDKit becomes a pkg installation package.</b> We made such decision due to our concern regarding that there are some places in the world which couldn't have stable access to GitHubâ€¦ such fact may ruin the recovery process while downloading factorial font files.

> If you don't trust this pkg, you could either use payload extractor (or similar tools) to reverse-engineer it or don't use it.

Currently, the AEDKit package is made only for OS X Yosemite.

<b>You could download this package via this URL</b>:
<pre><code>https://github.com/othercat/CJKFontScript/releases/download/Latest/YosemiteFactorialChineseGUIFontRecovery.pkg.zip</code></pre>
If you manually install this package (not via Terminal), the installer will prompt you to reboot your Mac.

<b>You could also perform unattended installation by using following Terminal command</b>:
<pre><code>sudo curl -L $'https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/raw/release/SuperOTC/SourceHanSans.ttc.zip?raw=true' -o ~/Desktop/YosemiteFactorialChineseGUIFontRecovery.pkg.zip
bsdtar -xvf ~/Desktop/YosemiteFactorialChineseGUIFontRecovery.pkg.zip
sudo installer -pkg ~/Desktop/YosemiteFactorialChineseGUIFontRecovery.pkg -target /</code></pre>
After successfully running those terminal commands above, you <b>have to reboot</b> your system as soon as possible.

END.
